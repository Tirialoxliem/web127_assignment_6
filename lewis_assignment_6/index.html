    <h1>Different Types of Dog Breed Groups</h1>
    <p id="p1">
      There is nothing in this world more comforting than having man's best
      friend by your side. Dogs are there for us anytime we need them, no matter
      what the situation is. There are dogs for any purpose. There are dogs to
      lay with you and comfort you when you are down, dogs that are there to
      work for you, dogs that are there to protect you, and so many more
      reasons. There are many dog groups, and we are going to talk about some of
      them in this site. The groups include herding, hunting, sporting,
      non-sporting, terrier, toy, working, foundation stock, and miscellaneous.
      Which type fits you?
