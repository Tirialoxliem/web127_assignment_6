    <h1>Hunting and Sporting Groups</h1>
    <div id="container">
      <p id="p1">
        As we move on to these next two groups, you might find the need for them
        if you are a hunter, or someone with special needs that need help to get
        things for them. The next group that we are going to talk about are the
        hunting, and sporting groups. The hunting group are bred to run and
        chase for long distances in hunting. They also have a great sense of
        smell. The sporting group have similarities but are not bred to run and
        chase for very long distances. Some of the breeds in the hunting group
        consist of Foxhound, Beagle, Afghan Hound, Basset Hound, Greyhound, and
        Dachshund. As for the sporting group, they consist of Retrievers,
        Setters, Spaniels, Pointers, and Vizslas. Do either of these two breeds
        fill your needs?
