        Let's start out with the working group. What do the working group of
        dogs do? These dogs are bread to do task such as pulling sleds, guarding
        people, helping people with needs, rescuing people, and many more
        things. These dogs are normally big in size due to the need for their
        demands. They work their jobs with absolutely no complaints. They feel
        honored that you trust them with your needs. Some of these breeds are
        Doberman Pinscher, Siberian Husky, Great Dane, Saint Bernard, Alaskan
        Malamute, Boxer, Rottweiler, and the Newfoundland. Do any of these dogs
        spike your interest?
