    <h1>Herding Group</h1>
    <div id="container">
      <p id="p1">
        The final group we will talk about is the herding group. This group has
        the forever job of herding on their mind. They were bred to herd cattle,
        and sheep, but do not be surprised if they herd your children either. If
        you are taking them for a walk and your children lag behind they will
        turn around at nip at them to get in place and "gather the herd". These
        dogs are great at their jobs, but do not be shocked when they keep your
        children, "the flock", in place. These breeds consist of the Border
        Collie, German Shephard, Old English Sheepdog, Puli, Collie, and the
        Corgi. Does this sound like the group for you to choose from? Have you
        decided between all the groups yet?
